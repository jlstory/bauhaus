The term "Program" resonates and pulls me into a feeling of comfort and of the presence of a plan as opposed to a distinct set of rules and opinions.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Bauhaus' focus on functionality and the process of forming a simple design around what one may think to be the "most" functional form allows the artist to become a creator of a different sort. Simple calculation, based on logic is meant to become the aestheic. This is beauty, in my opinion, though beauty may be seen in many ways; none of which are subjective to the ends of an entity such a mathematical law. By indicating functionality as the primary goal, the designer, artist, or artisian will be provided with the opportunity to explore the aesthetic as a means of facilitating function; this is a key concept that appears in all forms of design to some extent. This ideaology seems especially significant with regard to disciplines such as user interface or experience design.</span></span>

The movement encouraged teachers and students to pursue their crafts together in design studios and workshops. The school moved to Dessau in 1925 and then to Berlin in 1932, after which Bauhaus—under constant harassment by the Nazis—finally closed.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Bauhaus movement championed a geometric, abstract style featuring little sentiment or emotion and no historical nods, and its aesthetic continues to influence architects, designers and artists.</span></span><br>

People were starving, the Kaiser had fled and the new Republic got off to a troubled start for two reasons:<br>&nbsp;<br>Many Germans hated the government for signing the armistice in November 1918 - they called them the November criminals. The defeat in the war came as a huge surprise to the German people, and many ordinary German soldiers, which led to a theory that the brave German army had been "stabbed in the back" by the politicians.<br>&nbsp;<br>In early 1919 the victorious Allies met to discuss how to punish Germany and on 28 June 1919 the new German government was forced to sign a peace settlement called the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty punished Germany militarily, territorially and financially. Many Germans felt their country had received a very harsh deal in the treaty and resented the government for agreeing to its conditions. However, German government had been given an ultimatum &#45; sign within five days or risk invasion.

                <p class="h1_2 inf walt">Walter Gropius<span class="inf_text grop"><br>&nbsp;<br>One of the most highly regarded architects of the 20th century, Walter Gropius (18 May 1883 &#8208; 5 July 1969) was one of the founding
                    fathers of Modernism, and the founder of the Bauhaus, the German "School of Building" that embraced elements of art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design, and typography in its design, development and production.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like
                    many modernists of the period, Gropius was interested in the mechanization of work and the utilitarianism of newly developed factories. In 1908, he joined the studio of renowned German architect and industrial designer Peter Behrens,
                    where he worked alongside two people who would also later become notable modernist architects: Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe.<br>&nbsp;<br>However, of the three young architects at Behren's practice, Gropius was the first to put
                    his Modernist ideas to work. In 1911, he and Adolf Meyer designed the Fagus Factory, a glass and steel cubic building which pioneered modern architectural devices such as glass curtain walls, and was built from the floor plans of the
                    more traditional industrial architect Eduard Werner.<br>&nbsp;<br>In 1919, Gropius took over as master of the Grand-Ducal Saxon School of Arts and Crafts in Weimar, promptly turning it into The Bauhaus. From then until 1933, the school
                    was one of Europe's most progressive and influential schools of design, greatly influencing the current of modern art and architecture. The Bauhaus in Dessau was designed in 1925 by Gropius, who distilled his teachings into architectural
                    elements of the building.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gropius also contributed with published writings, discussing the Bauhaus Manifesto, the role of the artist, and the artist's relationship to his or her work. After emigrating to the United States,
                    Gropius continued his teachings and exploring the Bauhaus ideal. While teaching at Harvard University, he lived with his family in the self-designed Gropius House.</span>

                The ultimate goal of all <span class="dis">art<span class="dis_text"><img class="build me_dis" src="img/me.png" alt="profile image"><br>&nbsp;<br>Though all words are clearly defined by language systems, I do feel that some may be, to some extent, left to interpretation. My opinion is that this is true of the word art. I feel that the definition of this term can take many forms and mean many things to different people.<br>&nbsp;<br>Art, as I see it, is meant to be an expression of one&#8217;s self. It can be a means of emotional release, self expression, or simply created to gain the opportunity to experience its creation. I think of design very differently. While I do see design as an expression, it is not meant to be an expression of personal ideology, but rather an expression of the idea of another rendered as a communicative tool. I believe that both are necessary parts of culture or even life. <br>&nbsp;<br>I do not necessarily feel that “the ultimate goal of all art is the building”, art does not need a building to exist. It does not even need to be manifested into a tangible form, it could simply be an idea that exists only within the mind of the artist.<br>&nbsp;<br>When time permits, I love to play around in the art world whether that be in music composition and production, sound design, painting, or any number of interesting mediums. I almost never share my art, I create these things for myself and prefer to keep them safe within.</span></span>
                is <span class="inf">the building!<span class="inf_text"><img class="build weim" src="img/bauhaus_arch_1.png" alt="architecture of the bauhaus photo"><br>&nbsp;<br>“The ultimate goal of all art is the building!”, Walter Gropius made his point right from the start of the Bauhaus Manifesto. Art is no profession. Therefore, architects, sculptors, and painters must return craft. In other words, artist and artisan are the same. Rare are the moments of illumination beyond man&#x27;s will that may allow creation to blossom from the handmade work to the work of art, Gropius wrote in the prospectus. He wanted to recreate craftsmanship and erase the artificial barrier between "noble" artists and "working" craftsmen. For the aim of future building, he claimed that every art discipline should unite as one. That is exactly what he was doing with Bauhaus. It was an ambitious program aimed at freeing the art world of its isolation.</span></span>
                The <span class="crit">ornamentation<span class="crit_text"><img class="build me" src="img/me.png" alt="profile image"><br><img class="comparison" src="img/bauhaus_poster_comp.png" alt="bauhaus poster"><img class="comparison" src="img/art_n.png" alt="art neuveau poster"><img class="comparison" src="img/art_d.png" alt="art deco poster"><br>&nbsp;<br>Note the lack of ornamentation and use of simple geometry as compared to very ornate styles, with very different ideaologies like Art Neuveau and Art Deco. I can find beauty at both the very ornate and the very practical ends of the spectrum, both have thier purpose and place.</span></span>
                of the building was once the <span class="dis">main purpose of the visual arts,<span class="dis_text"><img class="build me_dis" src="img/me.png" alt="profile image"><br>&nbsp;<br>While I cannot argue against the statement that “The ornamentation of the main purpose of the visual arts”, I do not necessarily agree that this is intrinsically negative. I understand the argument for a push toward craftsmanship and practicality, but I do not condone the dismissal of the artist who creates purely for aesthetic pleasure, or even pain. Nor do I feel that art for art&#x27;s sake is time wasted. <br>&nbsp;<br> Bauhaus ideology has persisted because practicality is effective, if not efficient. A beautiful home, filled with luxurious ornamentation is without use if functionality has not been carefully considered. The same is not true of practicality without ornamentation, one could live comfortably in a shelter with no ornamentation at all. That said, a world filled with nothing aside from housing cubes would quickly become bland, boring, and depressing. Art imitates life, imitates art, in a cyclical fashion. Art for art&#x27;s sake holds many keys to societal structure and social norms.</span></span>
                and they were considered <span class="crit">indispensable<span class="crit_text"><img class="build me" src="img/me.png" alt="profile image"><br>On the thought of ornamentation being “indispensable”, I would have stand in agreement the philosophy of the Bauhaus. While ornamentation provides so much in context, beauty, and expression, to the extent that it may be utilized as a tool to help define a period of time, this does not make the use of ornamentation indispensable. Ultimately, we all NEED a means of survival and the provision or acquisition of basic needs. Ornamentation is not required for this, instead ornamentation serves to encourage this pursuit to become an enjoyable experience.</span></span>
                parts of the <span class="inf">great building.<span class="inf_text"><img class="build_house weim" src="img/gropius_house.jpg" alt="walter gropius house"><br>&nbsp;<br>FUN FACT:<br>&nbsp;<br>This is Walter Gropius&#x27; self designed home built in 1938. The name "Bauhaus" can be loosely translated as a blend of the verb “to build” and the noun, “house”.</span></span>
                Today, they exist in <span class="dis">complacent isolation<span class="dis_text"><img class="build me_dis" src="img/me.png" alt="profile image"><br>&nbsp;<br>As I read, “Today they exist in complacent isolation”, I feel that perhaps this is an overstatement. Nothing exists in absolute isolation, all things form a one. Yes, a factory will have many stations with many people performing quite different functions. Each person working in this factory is ultimately working toward the same goal, however different their role may be. My argument here is that, while creating ornamentation or art is a separate role, it does not necessarily exist as an isolated entity. It can, if that visual art is the sole purpose, but if one were to design the most ornate and extravagant bridge, connecting the eastern and western worlds, from a truly isolated perspective, engineers will likely refuse to build it, and I will never take a chance on driving over it if they do. In this way, though the artist and artisan may not always be a single person, they ultimately must work as one to achieve their vision.</span></span>,
                from which they can only be salvaged by the <span class="crit">purposeful and cooperative endeavours<span class="crit_text"><img class="build me" src="img/me.png" alt="profile image"><br>This is largely a restatement of my argument against the existence of true isolation. While the ideals and methodologies at play differ from a form so ornate as Art Nouveau, both embrace a union of skills. This is necessary for the construct of a society. So, yes, we must all work together. This idea expands far beyond the boundaries that contain the worlds of art and design. To accomplish and endure we must come together as one. Cooperative endeavor, or the idea of this, is not unique to the Bauhaus way of thinking. We have always needed one another to succeed.</span></span>
                of all artisans. Architects, painters and sculptors must learn a new way of seeing and understanding the composite character of the building, both as a totality and in terms of its parts. Their work will then re-imbue itself with the spirit of architecture,
                which it lost in <span class="dis">salon art<span class="dis_text"><img class="build me_dis" src="img/me.png" alt="profile image"><br>&nbsp;<br>Salon, derived from the French word salon (a living room or parlor), means a conversational gathering. Usually, this is a select group of intellectuals, artists, and politicians who meet in the private residence of a socially influential (and often wealthy) person.<br>&nbsp;<br>By this definition, the focus is the living space meant to impress with ornamentation or decor. I would have to agree that this may be somewhat wasteful. This contrasts drastically with a function forward approach. However, nothing is lost is art, salon or otherwise. Only the artist holds the ability to truly understand thier artistic endeavor. If I choose to create an artwork for my own pleasure, or experience, I have wasted nothiing so long as my intention is met. It is dismissive of inward thought to imply that to create art could ever be time lost. Every second is time spent, only the individual can proclaim this time to be a loss. Art holds value that does not apply to design, design holds value that means nothing to art... Yet, in some sense they hold many of the same aspirations, one is not of more value simply because someone finds it to be practical and useful.</span></span>.
            </p>
            <p class="p1">
                <span class="inf">The art schools of old<span class="inf_text">I like to contrast Bauhaus styling with that of Art Nouveau and Art Deco, the level of contrast paints a clear picture. This is despite a bit of overlap in time frame... All three styles remain in the context of the now.<br>&nbsp;<br><img class="rooms_img" src="img/ar_n_room.jpg" alt="art neuveau style"><img class="rooms_img" src="img/art_d_room.jpg" alt="art deco style"><img class="rooms_img" src="img/bauhaus_room.jpg" alt="art deco style"><br>&nbsp;<br>Art Nouveau and Art Déco were two powerful movements that dominated the worlds of fine art, design, and architecture at the turn of the 20th century. While Art Déco was more geometric and modernist, Art Nouveau was inspired by nature, featuring sinuous lines and organic shapes. It considered art to be a conceptual whole, searching for harmony in every element of a structure, from its walls and windows to its door handles, furniture, and decorative flourishes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Art Déco emerged in the 1920s as a successor to Art Nouveau. Its aim was to embrace the machine-made products of the industrial age, which Art Nouveau had protested against. By emphasizing artistic decoration through simple, clean lines and shapes, and ornamenting them with stylized geometric patterns, it embraced industrial materials and mechanization of the modern era. It started in the fashion and jewelry industries, then influenced furniture design, interior spaces, and architecture.</span></span>
                were incapable of producing this unity—and how could they, for <span class="crit">art may not be taught.<span class="crit_text"><img class="build me" src="img/me.png" alt="profile image"><br>I find the statement, “…art may not be taught” intriguing. Can art be taught? One can certainly be taught to reproduce art, but I am not convinced that mimicry is the same thing as creation or reproduction the same a production. Principles and rules can be taught, guidelines and best practices can be taught, hierarchy, dimension, perspective, and on and on… But does the acquisition of this information equivocate to an understanding of art? I feel that art, at least in a pure form, must be derived from within one&#x27;s self. This is not to say that the advice and techniques of others is without value by any means, but a paining is not art because of the technique, it is art because of the meaning.</span></span>
                They must return to the workshop. This world of mere drawing and painting of draughtsmen and applied artists must at long last become a world that builds. When a young person who senses within himself a love for creative endeavour begins his career, as
                in the past, by learning a trade, the unproductive “artist” will no longer be condemned to the imperfect practice of art because his skill is now preserved in craftsmanship, where he may achieve excellence.
            </p>
            <p class="p1">
                Architects, sculptors, painters—we all must return to craftsmanship! For there is no such thing as “art by profession.” There is no essential difference between the artist and the artisan. The artist is an exalted artisan. Merciful heaven, in rare moments
                of illumination beyond man&#39;s will, may allow art to blossom from the work of his hand, but the foundations of proficiency are indispensable to every artist. This is the original source of creative design.
            </p>
            <p class="p1">
                So let us therefore create a new guild of craftsmen, free of the divisive class pretensions that endeavoured to raise a prideful barrier between craftsmen and artists! Let us strive for, conceive and create the new building of the future that will unite
                every discipline, architecture and sculpture and painting, and which will one day rise heavenwards from the million hands of craftsmen as a clear symbol of a new belief to come.
